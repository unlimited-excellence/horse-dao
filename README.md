## General Idea

HORSE DAO is an autonomous, decentralized community for people who study and love solving algorithmic problems. Our vision is to create a self-organized ecosystem where members earn a native crypto token by participating in contests and educational events. These tokens not only reward individual effort but also empower users to influence reward scales and community management decisions, fostering a democratic, self-regulating environment.

## MVP Overview

Our current MVP is a Telegram bot built with Python and backed by MongoDB. It focuses on validating the core idea:

- **User Registration & Linking:**  
  Users begin by registering with the bot and linking their Codeforces account. The bot generates a unique control code, which users must post on their Codeforces profile for verification.

- **Token Accrual:**  
  Tokens are awarded based on a participant’s performance in official rounds. Rather than awarding a fixed amount per solved problem, rewards are calculated according to the participant’s final ranking. This approach recognizes overall contest performance, rewarding higher placements and encouraging consistent excellence.

- **Token Transfers:**  
  Users can view their token balance and transfer tokens to others through simple commands.

## Future Plans

We plan to expand the platform by integrating additional coding sites like AtCoder and by adding new features. One upcoming feature is the ability for users to designate coaches, enabling coaches to share tokens with and support participants - essentially allowing token investments in the growth and success of community members.
