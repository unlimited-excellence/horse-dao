## Abstract

The HORSE Project is a decentralized ecosystem that **tokenizes knowledge** and intellectual achievements in various fields. The core idea is to reward participants in intellectual competitions (programming, mathematics, physics, etc.) for their success by granting them a special crypto token, **HORSE**, for their accomplishments. This approach combines learning and earning, creating a **"learn-to-earn"** model where knowledge and skills are directly converted into a digital asset. The project also aims to connect generations: experienced mentors and teachers can support young talent through sponsorship mechanisms and knowledge investment.

The HORSE internal economy features **unlimited token issuance**, as intellectual work has no limits - the more problems solved, the more value is created, which is reflected in new tokens. Issuance is strictly tied to real achievements and controlled by a reward formula that disproportionately incentivizes the best performers. The HORSE token serves not only as a reward but also as a **utility token** for participating in ecosystem governance: the community can vote on project development and support new initiatives through **DAO** mechanisms. This document outlines the HORSE team's vision, the project's key principles, the token's economic model, and use cases that demonstrate how HORSE will change the approach to evaluating intellectual achievements.

## 1. Introduction: The Value of Knowledge in the Digital Age

An analysis of the modern labor market and educational systems shows a lack of direct material reward for intellectual achievements, which limits motivation and investment in talent development. Traditional evaluation and reward systems in education and competitive fields (grades, diplomas, medals, ratings) do not always provide direct financial motivation, which can affect engagement and the long-term value of intellectual efforts.

The HORSE Project offers an innovative solution to eliminate the existing imbalance in rewarding intellectual work. The project is based on the principle that intellectual activity generates significant value that can be tokenized using blockchain technology. Similar to the "play-to-earn" concept in video games, where players earn cryptocurrency for their achievements, HORSE introduces a **"learn-to-earn"** model, where the process of learning and competing brings a real financial incentive.

The HORSE Project is designed to create a new economy of knowledge, where knowledge, skills, and mental effort become capital. This approach not only motivates individual participants to improve but also develops the community: new opportunities arise for mentoring, knowledge exchange, and investment in human intellect. For investors, this initiative is interesting because it creates a unique asset class - a token whose value is supported by real intellectual achievements and the activity of a talented community.

## 2. The Problem: Underestimation of Intellectual Capital

In the modern world, intellectual efforts, from solving complex math problems to writing code, are often underestimated in material terms. Young talents spend thousands of hours on learning and competitions, gaining invaluable knowledge, but traditional rewards like grades, diplomas, or medals do not always reflect the material value of this work. This imbalance leads to:

* **Limited motivation**: The lack of a direct financial incentive can reduce long-term motivation for intense learning and skill development.
* **Inefficient resource allocation**: Intellectual capital, the driving force of innovation, does not receive proper economic valuation, which hinders its effective investment and scaling.
* **Lack of a transparent recognition mechanism**: Traditional systems do not always provide a universal, transparent, and verifiable way to recognize intellectual achievements that would be globally understood and valued.

The HORSE Project solves this problem by offering a mechanism to tokenize intellectual achievements, turning them into a tangible digital asset that stimulates the development of and investment in human capital.

## 3. The Solution: The HORSE Ecosystem and Knowledge Tokenization

HORSE is designed as an ecosystem that spans various platforms and fields of knowledge, where HORSE tokens are granted for success in intellectual competitions.

### 3.1. Tokenization of Intellectual Achievements

In the first phase, the project is integrated with the competitive programming platform Codeforces. After each official Codeforces round, participants automatically receive HORSE tokens according to their rank. This process is already working through a dedicated Telegram bot launched by the team in April 2025. The pilot contest Horse.Run(), held on April 15, 2025, successfully demonstrated the functionality of the token granting system, laying the groundwork for future regular rewards.

The HORSE ecosystem will expand to other platforms and fields of knowledge, including AtCoder, LeetCode, Kaggle, math Olympiads, and educational platforms. The HORSE token will serve as a universal reward for intellectual achievements regardless of the field. This is knowledge tokenization in its purest form, where every contribution to the progress of science or technology can be digitized and monetized. The reward criteria are objective, based on competition results and ratings verified on the respective platforms. Integration with the APIs of these platforms ensures data transparency and reliability.

### 3.2. Motivation through Gamification

Combining diverse intellectual activities under a single token adds a gamification element to learning. Participants receive instant feedback on their success in the form of tokens. This complements the internal motivation to learn with an external incentive, creating a competitive effect not just for rank or a diploma, but for a real digital asset. HORSE doesn't replace traditional educational goals but enhances them: the token serves as a sort of "quality mark" or digital trophy for knowledge.

### 3.3. Connecting Generations: Mentorship and Investing in Talent

HORSE aims to create a strong connection between generations of knowledge, ensuring that the experience of older generations is continuously passed on to younger ones, and that mentors are financially invested in their students' success.

* **Rewarded Mentorship**: Mentor smart contract mechanisms allow teachers, coaches, or older students to act as mentors for young talent and receive a portion of the tokens for the successes of those they mentor. This provides direct monetization of mentors' intellectual contributions and creates an economic incentive for active knowledge and experience exchange within the community.
* **Investing in Education and Talent**: The project provides for talent sponsorship models similar to venture investments but in the field of education. Community members holding HORSE tokens will be able to invest in promising students. This approach is functionally similar to an income share agreement model but is implemented using crypto tokens and smart contracts. It helps to lower financial barriers for talented youth by redistributing some of the investment risks to sponsors in exchange for a potential future tokenized reward.
* **Knowledge Exchange and Community**: HORSE encourages knowledge exchange within the community, uniting different generations around a shared token and project. For active contributions to the collective intellectual knowledge base (e.g., writing high-quality educational content or creating new problems), participants can also receive tokens.

## 4. HORSE Tokenomics: Unlimited Issuance and the "Learn-to-Earn" Model

### 4.1. Issuance Model and Token Value

The **HORSE Token** has unlimited issuance, based on the assumption of unlimited potential for knowledge generation, which requires a flexible reward model without fixed limits. New tokens are released gradually and only as new intellectual achievements appear in the system, tied to community activity. This dynamic supply model ensures a balance between token supply, community size, and its achievements.

Despite the unlimited token supply, mechanisms are in place (issuance formula, DAO-governed parameters) to regulate the rate of release and maintain the token's value stability in the long term. The **"fair launch"** principle excludes pre-mining or an ICO, helping to build trust and ensure equal conditions for all participants, where tokens are earned exclusively through demonstrating knowledge and skills. Team members can earn tokens by participating in contests or through community-approved grants. This approach ensures maximum fairness and trust: no centralized party can "print" tokens for themselves - the only way to get HORSE is to demonstrate knowledge and skills.

### 4.2. Reward Distribution Formula

The distribution of HORSE tokens based on competition results follows a meritocratic cubic model, meaning the higher a participant's rank, the disproportionately more tokens they receive. This emphasizes the value of outstanding results and encourages competition for top positions.

The reward formula for a participant who ranked **S** among **P** participants (who solved at least one problem), in a team of **M** members, is as follows:

$$Reward = \frac{(\frac{P-S+1}{P})^3 \times K \times 10}{M}$$

Where **P** is the number of participants who solved at least one problem; **S** is the participant's rank (1 for the winner, P for the last person who solved a problem); **K** is a coefficient that depends on the type of competition (**1** for Div. 4, **1.5** for Div. 3, **2** for Div. 2, **2.5** for Div. 1 + Div. 2, **3** for Div. 1); **M** is the number of participants in the user's team.

These parameters can be adjusted through DAO mechanisms. The choice of a cubic dependency is justified by the goal of strengthening the differentiation of rewards between high and average results, reflecting the increased value of outstanding achievements. The project's philosophy provides for a disproportionately high reward for outstanding achievements, which correlates with their significant impact and value to the community.

**Example Reward Calculation:**

Imagine a programming competition with 100 participants connected to HORSE. The base reward for the winner is set at 10 HORSE (determined by parameters K, M). After the contest, 80 participants solved at least one problem.

* 1st place (winner) receives 10.0 HORSE.
* 2nd place: ≈9.12 HORSE.
* 10th place: ≈7.53 HORSE.
* 40th place: ≈2.28 HORSE.
* 80th place (last to solve a problem): ≈0.093 HORSE.
* 81st-100th places (those who solved nothing): 0 HORSE.

This example shows how the HORSE formula implements the principle of meritocracy: everyone receives according to their contribution, and it's non-linear to emphasize the value of top results. The issuance of HORSE tokens is directly related to the community's intellectual activity, ensuring new tokens are released only in response to the generation of new knowledge and achievements.

### 4.3. Utility Token and Value for Holders

The **HORSE token** serves a dual role: a reward and a utility token. Its utilitarian purpose includes participating in project governance through the DAO. As the ecosystem develops, other uses for HORSE will emerge, such as:

* Access to special educational resources or courses using tokens.
* Payment for participation in private contests or training sessions.
* Staking tokens to receive additional bonuses or a share of the platform's profits.
* NFTs that confirm achievements (e.g., NFT medals for won Olympiads, tied to the HORSE tokens received).

The value of HORSE is supported not by scarcity but by its utility and the community's contribution. It's expected that a significant portion of the tokens earned by top performers will be held as a "symbol of achievement" or for governance participation, which will reduce selling pressure. The project aims to create a self-regulating economic model where the growth of token supply correlates with an increase in the ecosystem's fundamental value.

## 5. Community Governance and DAO

**Decentralization** is one of HORSE's core principles. Although the technical implementation and support of the system are initially carried out by the Unlimited Excellence team, the project is strategically moving towards handing over key decisions to the community through a **DAO** (decentralized autonomous organization) mechanism. The HORSE token acts as a ticket to this governance system: every token holder can participate in votes on the ecosystem's development.

### 5.1. Governance Principles

After achieving sufficient decentralization of token ownership, a DAO will be launched, where decisions are made by a majority vote of token holders. The subjects of these votes can be:

* **Issuance parameters**: Changes to the constants in the reward formula.
* **Expansion to new platforms**: Choosing which competitions or platforms to connect to HORSE next.
* **Fund allocation**: Funding for marketing, grants for educational initiatives, bug-fix bounties, or new feature development.
* **Participation rules**: Changes to the criteria for token distribution or the introduction of new types of rewarded activity.
* **Protocol improvements**: Smart contract updates, bug fixes, changes to the technical infrastructure.
* **Other initiatives**: Launching a mentorship program funded through the DAO or partnerships with educational organizations.

The implementation of the DAO model aims to increase trust in HORSE by eliminating centralized control, ensuring transparent decision-making, and preventing unilateral rule changes or token appropriation. The smart contracts that manage the HORSE token will be public and audited. The project is preparing for full blockchain integration to make processes transparent and open to auditing.

### 5.2. Investor Participation in the DAO

For investors, holding HORSE tokens is interesting not only for speculative potential but also for the ability to influence the project's development. HORSE gives a voice in shaping the future of the educational blockchain ecosystem. The HORSE team aims for the project to become self-governing and sustainable in the long term, where various stakeholders collectively determine priorities.

## 7. Market Analysis and Competitive Landscape

### 7.1. Analysis of the "Learn-to-Earn" Market and IP Tokenization

The **"learn-to-earn"** model is a new concept, similar to "play-to-earn," that turns learning and skills into financial incentives. Intellectual property (IP) tokenization is the process of converting ownership or usage rights of IP assets (patents, copyrights, data) into digital tokens, often NFTs. This allows for fractional ownership, increases liquidity and transparency, and automates revenue distribution through smart contracts.

Investments in blockchain technologies for education are projected to grow significantly, estimated to reach approximately $883.31 million by 2028. This underscores the growing confidence in the transformative impact of blockchain on the education sector. HORSE is positioned at the intersection of these markets, offering a unique solution for monetizing intellectual achievements.

### 7.2. Competitive Landscape and HORSE's Unique Value Proposition

The market includes traditional educational and competitive programming platforms (Codeforces, AtCoder, LeetCode), as well as other blockchain projects in education that focus on credentials or peer-to-peer learning.

**HORSE's Unique Value Proposition (UVP):**

* **Focus on intellectual achievements**: HORSE rewards real results in competitions, not just participation or basic learning.
* **Meritocratic cubic reward system**: Provides disproportionately higher rewards for leaders, stimulating the pursuit of excellence.
* **Intergenerational mentorship and sponsorship**: Creates economic incentives for knowledge exchange and investment in talent.
* **DAO governance**: Ensures decentralized decision-making and community control over project development.
* **"Fair Launch" principle**: The absence of pre-mining or an ICO enhances trust and fairness.

HORSE stands out from other projects with its comprehensive model that not only rewards but also creates an ecosystem for development, mentorship, and investment in intellectual capital.

## 8. Risk Factors and Assumptions

Any innovative project involves certain risks. The HORSE Project aims to be transparent and open about potential challenges.

### 8.1. Key Risk Factors

* **Market volatility**: The value of the HORSE token, like any cryptocurrency, can be subject to significant fluctuations, affecting investment appeal and participant motivation.
* **Regulatory uncertainty**: The legal regulation of cryptocurrencies and blockchain projects is constantly changing and varies across jurisdictions, which may create challenges for scaling and operations.
* **Competition**: The growth of the "learn-to-earn" and IP tokenization markets may lead to increased competition from new projects or traditional players integrating blockchain technologies.
* **Technical execution risks**: The implementation of a complex ecosystem, integration with numerous platforms, and the transition to full decentralization through a DAO require significant technical effort and may face unforeseen difficulties.
* **Adoption and acceptance challenges**: HORSE's success depends on widespread adoption by participants (students, engineers), mentors, and investors. Low engagement could slow the ecosystem's growth.
* **Liquidity risks**: In the initial stages of development, the market liquidity of the HORSE token may be limited, affecting the ability to easily exchange tokens.

### 8.2. Key Assumptions

* **Effectiveness of inflation management through DAO**: It is assumed that the DAO can effectively adjust parameters K and M to manage inflation and maintain the token's value stability in the long term. The effectiveness of such adjustments depends on the active and informed participation of the community.
* **Community absorption of growing token supply**: It is assumed that the growth of community activity and token utility will be sufficient to "absorb" the increased token supply without diluting its value. This is tied to the expansion of token utility functions and the growth of the ecosystem.
* **Behavior of top performers**: It is expected that top performers will hold tokens as a "symbol of achievement" or for governance participation, which will reduce selling pressure. This is an assumption about user behavior and motivation.
* **Multiplicative effect of human capital**: The project is based on the assumption that "human capital, supported by economic incentives, can create a significant multiplicative effect."
* **Technical feasibility of transitioning to oracles and smart contracts without loss of efficiency**: The Whitepaper notes plans for a gradual transition from a centralized backend to using oracles and smart contracts directly as soon as it becomes technically feasible without losing efficiency.

## 9. Conclusion

The **HORSE Project** offers a groundbreaking model that merges the world of knowledge with the world of decentralized finance. In this model, knowledge becomes an income-generating asset, and intellectual communities gain a tool for self-development and self-governance. For investors, HORSE opens the door to supporting a promising ecosystem at the intersection of EdTech and blockchain, one that is growing alongside the global **"learn-to-earn"** trend. The HORSE team's long-term vision is that within 5-10 years, intellectual achievements in science and programming will receive recognition and material rewards comparable to those in sports or the arts. By realizing the vision of tokenized intellect, HORSE is laying the foundation for such a future today.

The project is being built from the ground up by and for the community, with transparent rules and open-source code. There is a lot of work ahead: expanding to new platforms, improving algorithms, launching the DAO, and developing partnerships with educational organizations. All of this will be possible with the support of enthusiasts and investors who see the potential in uniting generations around the idea of the value of knowledge. HORSE has already taken its first steps - the first tokens have been issued, the first competitions have been held, and the community is growing. The project invites interested individuals to join the development of the HORSE ecosystem.
